# Experiment 1: Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram

## üéØ Objective:
To understand and apply the concepts of ER modeling by creating an ER diagram for a real-world application.

## üìö Purpose:
The purpose of this workshop is to gain hands-on experience in designing ER diagrams that visually represent the structure of a database including entities, relationships, attributes, and constraints.

## üß™ Choose One Scenario:

### üîπ Scenario 1: University Database
Design a database to manage students, instructors, programs, courses, and student enrollments. Include prerequisites for courses.

**User Requirements:**
- Academic programs grouped under departments.
- Students have admission number, name, DOB, contact info.
- Instructors with staff number, contact info, etc.
- Courses have number, name, credits.
- Track course enrollments by students and enrollment date.
- Add support for prerequisites (some courses require others).

---

### üîπ Scenario 2: Hospital Database
Design a database for patient management, appointments, medical records, and billing.

**User Requirements:**
- Patient details including contact and insurance.
- Doctors and their departments, contact info, specialization.
- Appointments with reason, time, patient-doctor link.
- Medical records with treatments, diagnosis, test results.
- Billing and payment details for each appointment.

## üìù Tasks:
1. Identify entities, relationships, and attributes.
2. Draw the ER diagram using any tool (draw.io, dbdiagram.io, hand-drawn and scanned).
3. Include:
   - Cardinality & participation constraints
   - Prerequisites for University OR Billing for Hospital
4. Explain:
   - Why you chose the entities and relationships.
   - How you modeled prerequisites or billing.

## Relationships and Constraints:
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Patient-Doctor Relationship

- A **Patient** can consult one or more **Doctors**.
- A **Doctor** can treat multiple **Patients**.
- üîÅ **Type**: Many-to-Many (M:N)

> ‚úÖ **Implementation Tip**: Use a junction/association table like `Patient_Doctor(P-ID, E-ID)` to manage this relationship.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Nurse-Rooms Relationship

- A **Nurse** can be assigned to multiple **Rooms** during their shift.
- A **Room** can have multiple **Nurses** assigned across different shifts.
- üîÅ **Type**: Many-to-Many (M:N)

> ‚úÖ **Implementation Tip**: Create a link table such as `Nurse_Room(E-ID, R-ID)`.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Receptionist-Records Relationship

- A **Receptionist** manages multiple **Records** (e.g., appointments, patient logs).
- A **Record** can be handled by multiple **Receptionists**.
- üîÅ **Type**: Many-to-Many (M:N)

> ‚úÖ **Implementation Tip**: Use a mapping table like `Receptionist_Records(E-ID, Record-no)`.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Patient-Bills Relationship

- A **Patient** can have multiple **Bills**.
- Each **Bill** is tied to only **one Patient**.
- üîÅ **Type**: One-to-Many (1:N)

> ‚úÖ **Implementation Tip**: Place `P-ID` as a foreign key in the `Bill` table.

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Patient-Test Report Relationship

- A **Patient** can have multiple **Test Reports**.
- Each **Test Report** belongs to only one **Patient**.
- üîÅ **Type**: One-to-Many (1:N)

> ‚úÖ **Implementation Tip**: Include `P-ID` as a foreign key in the `Test_Report` table.

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Room-Patient Relationship

- A **Room** can be assigned to multiple **Patients** over time.
- A **Patient** stays in only one **Room** at a time.
- üîÅ **Type**: One-to-Many (1:N)

> ‚úÖ **Implementation Tip**: Use `R-ID` as a foreign key in the `Patient_Room` table, with check-in/check-out dates to track history.
...

## üìå Extension (Prerequisite / Billing)

### üîπ Billing Model:
Billing is modeled as a **One-to-Many** relationship between `Patient` and `Bill`.  
- A single patient can generate multiple bills over time due to consultations, tests, surgeries, room charges, etc.
- Each `Bill` is uniquely identified with `B-ID` and contains a foreign key `P-ID` referencing the patient who is liable for payment.
- This design keeps billing modular and traceable per service.

> üí° If future functionality requires itemized billing, we can extend this with a `Bill_Details` table that captures breakdowns (e.g., doctor fee, room charge, test fees) per `B-ID`.

---

## üéØ Design Choices

### ‚úÖ Entities:
- We created **core entities** such as `Patient`, `Employee`, `Room`, `Test_Report`, and `Bill` to mirror real-world hospital components.
- The `Employee` table acts as a super-entity for roles like `Doctor`, `Nurse`, and `Receptionist` to avoid redundancy and promote normalization.

### ‚úÖ Relationships:
- **Many-to-Many** relationships (e.g., Patient-Doctor, Nurse-Room, Receptionist-Records) are handled through **junction tables**, which scale better and preserve data integrity.
- **One-to-Many** relationships (e.g., Patient-Bill, Patient-Test Report) ensure that dependent entities like bills and reports are clearly tied to a parent patient.

### ‚úÖ Assumptions:
- Each role (Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist) inherits from a common Employee base using the `E-ID` foreign key.
- A patient can only occupy **one room at a time**, but a room can serve multiple patients over time‚Äîtracked via room assignments.
- All time-based associations (e.g., room stay duration) are assumed to be handled via timestamps or logs in extension tables if needed.

> ‚öôÔ∏è This schema is designed to be normalized, flexible for future enhancements (like treatment history or inventory management), and easy to extend with minimal refactoring.

## RESULT
The experiment successfully demonstrates the design of a normalized relational database schema for a hospital management system.
